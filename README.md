# ParkingLot

This is home for smaller, unfinished, or concept projects that I've worked on.

## Folder Structure

### `/Calculators/`
This folder contains basic calculators created while studying the basics of different languages.

- **`C#/`**: A simple calculator built using C#.  
- **`JavaScriptCss/`**: A basic calculator with a theme inspired by a child's iPad design, using JavaScript and CSS.

### `/TheTechAcademyProjects/`
Projects completed during my bootcamp at The Tech Academy, with some personal tweaks.

- **`AcademyCinemas/`**: A project focused on learning and applying Bootstrap for responsive design.  
- **`PetShop/`**: A project aimed at refining basic HTML and CSS skills, including the creation of contact pages.  
- **`SimpleRecipes/`**: A project focused on media sizing, CSS effects, and interactive buttons.

### `/TriviaPage/`
A random One Piece-themed trivia page with a simple quiz.  
I might make more since it was fun, but this is where they'll end up.

### `/WebMockups/`
A collection of outlines, skeletons, and color themes for web page concepts.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a **sandbox** for projects in progress, learning exercises, and random ideas.
Many of these projects are incomplete or represent first iterations, but each demonstrates my progress and experimentation as I build my skills in web development and programming.

Feel free to explore the folders to see my work with different languages, tools, and frameworks.
